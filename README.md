# URLOpener

This extension offers a convenient solution for users who need to access multiple links at once. With the ability to input an unlimited number of links, separated by a variety of delimiters (new line, comma, semicolon, space), users can easily organize and access their desired websites in a single click. The extension will then automatically open all of the links in separate tabs within the user's web browser, saving time and effort by eliminating the need to manually open each link individually. This feature can be particularly useful for research, multitasking, or any other situation where quick access to multiple web pages is necessary.
